# Dots

My configuration files for my systems.

### X11 Environment

I use a combination of cwm and [wmutils scripts](https://github.com/lwilletts/fwm)
to use my environment. I also use these programs to fill out other needs:

- urxvt: terminal emulator
- nnn: file browsing
- sxhkd: wm agnostic hotkey binding
- lemonbar: a nice bar with clickable support
- dmenu: program launching, I use a patched version with geometry positioning
- hsetroot: setting a background
- [mpvc](https://github.com/lwilletts/mpvc): commandline music playing
- i3lock: for locking the screen

### bin

Various scripts to use dmenu `(durl)`, lemonbar `(bar)` and i3lock `(lock)` are
included here along with other cool things like:

- `img`: display images in the terminal using w3m builtin image viewer
- `startmenu`: quick start cli menu
- `load`: opens appropriate program when a link is opened within urxvt
